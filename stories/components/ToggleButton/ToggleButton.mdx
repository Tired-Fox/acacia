## Toggle Button

A toggle button has the same features as the normal button with addition to a toggled state. This is mostly represented
with `aria-pressed` being set to `true` or `false` if the button is toggled or not.

### Normal

<Canvas of={ToggleButtonStories.Normal} />

### Using Different Element
<Canvas of={ToggleButtonStories.DifferentTag} />

### Symbols

Using symbols or non-accessible text inside the button will require that the `label` prop is provided. This is to meet
aria requirements with the button needed some form of accessible label/text.
